# Exploratory Testing

The purpose of this section is to explore the behavior of the **Promotions** feature of the Entertainment Website. This section is critical as it showcases various promotions and offers to users, enhancing their engagement with the platform. The focus will be on testing the most relevant flows of the **Promotions** page and a specific **Promotion Details** page.

The exploratory testing session will aim to provide the next findings of the **Promotions** feature.
- Relevant **flows**
- UX **improvements**
- Potential **Risks**
- **Bugs**

The **flows** are described using Gherkin syntax in [Promotions.feature](Promotions.feature) to ensure clarity, structure and normalized language in the testing process.

The rest of the findings are described in the [ExploratoryTestingSessionReport.md](ExploratoryTestingSessionReport.md) document.
